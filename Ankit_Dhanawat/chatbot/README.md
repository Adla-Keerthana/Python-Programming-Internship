# Chatbot Documentation

### Overview
This Python script implements a simple chatbot using the `nltk` library for natural language processing. The chatbot responds to user queries and provides predefined responses for certain topics.

### Code Structure
The code consists of the following components:

1. Importing necessary libraries:
    ```python
    import nltk
    from nltk.chat.util import Chat, reflections
    ```

2. Defining patterns and responses:
    ```python
    pairs = [
        ['hi|hello|hey', ['Hello!', 'Hi there!', 'Hey!']],
        ['how are you?', ['I am doing well, thank you!', 'I am good, thanks for asking!']],
        ['what is your name?', ['I am just a chatbot.', 'I am a chatbot designed to assist you.']],
        ['what can you do?', ['I can provide information on various topics. Feel free to ask me anything!']],
        ['bye|goodbye', ['Goodbye!', 'Bye! Have a great day!']],
        ['(.*) weather (.*)', ['Sorry, I cannot provide weather information at the moment.']],
        ['(.*) news (.*)', ['I am not able to provide news updates right now.']],
        ['(.*) time (.*)', ['Sorry, I cannot provide time information currently.']]
    ]
    ```

3. Creating a `Chat` object:
    ```python
    chat = Chat(pairs, reflections)
    ```

4. Defining a function to handle user input and generate chatbot response:
    ```python
    def chat_respond(user_input):
        return chat.respond(user_input)
    ```

5. Defining the main function to interact with the chatbot:
    ```python
    def main():
        print("Hello! I'm a simple chatbot.")
        
        while True:
            user_input = input("You : ")
            response = chat_respond(user_input)
            print("Bot:",response)
            if user_input.lower() == 'bye':
                break
    ```

6. Executing the main function:
    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

### Usage
To run the chatbot:
1. Ensure you have the `nltk` library installed. If not, you can install it using `pip install nltk`.
2. Copy the provided code into a Python script (e.g., `simple_chatbot.py`).
3. Run the script in a Python environment.
4. Interact with the chatbot by entering text input when prompted.

### Extending Functionality
To extend the functionality of the chatbot:
- Add more patterns and responses in the `pairs` list to handle a wider range of user queries.
- Integrate external APIs to provide real-time information on specific topics like weather, news, or time.
- Implement more sophisticated natural language processing techniques for better understanding of user queries.
