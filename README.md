Introduction
------------

Welcome to the Python Programming Internship with CSEdge! During this journey, you'll tackle various tasks aimed at expanding your knowledge and expertise in Python programming. This document presents 12 tasks divided into three categories—Easy, Medium, and Hard.

Instructions
------------

- Attempt the tasks according to their difficulty level, beginning with the easiest ones.
- Focus on solving only one category—Easy, Medium, or Hard—for now.
- Write functions, classes, modules, tests, and documentation where required.
- Keep your code organized, modular, and easy to read.
- Comment your solutions thoroughly, explaining how they work and why you made certain decisions.
- Save your finished work in appropriately labeled folders under your named folder.
- Send the entire collection of source codes, along with necessary instructions, to your designated mentor via a share link on GitHub.

Evaluation Criteria
-------------------

- Correctness of implemented algorithms and logic
- Quality of code (structure, comments, naming conventions, etc.)
- Performance and optimization efforts
- Efficient use of external libraries when needed
- Problem-solving creativity and originality

Now let's dive into the tasks!

### Easy Level Tasks

Task 1: String Reversal
-----------------------

Write a function called `reverse_string(input_str)` which accepts a string as an argument and returns the reversed version without spaces.


Task 2: Palindrome Checker
-------------------------

Create a function named `is_palindrome(word)` that takes a word as input and determines whether it reads the same backward as forward. Return True if it does; otherwise, return False.


Task 3: Count Vowels and Consonants
----------------------------------

Create a function named `count_vowels_and_consonants(sentence)` which receives a sentence and calculates the count of vowels and consonants separately. It should output a dictionary with keys 'vowels' and 'consonants', both having integer values representing counts.


Task 4: Find Common Elements
----------------------------

Given two lists, write a function `find_common_elements(list1, list2)` which outputs a new list containing common items found in both given arrays.

### Medium level tasks

Task 5: Array Manipulation with NumPy
-------------------------------------

Utilizing NumPy, develop a script that performs the following array manipulations:

- Generating random matrices with dimensions 3x3 and 5x5
- Calculating matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transposition
- Computing determinant, trace, inverse, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors


Task 6: Data Analysis with Pandas
---------------------------------

Load the "Iris" dataset from Seaborn and analyze it using Pandas. Perform exploratory data analysis, cleaning, aggregation, visualizations, and correlation calculations.


Task 7: Basic NLP with NLTK
---------------------------

Perform tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, stopwords removal, and stemming on sentences using the NLTK library.


Task 8: Linear Regression with Scikit-learn
--------------------------------------------

Apply linear regression to predict house prices from Boston housing dataset using scikit-learn. Compare train and test scores and plot residuals.

### Hard Level Tasks

Task 9: Image Converter
-----------------------
Write a program that accepts images in multiple formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF) and converts them into desired format using Python Imaging Library (PIL).

Task 10: Image Compressor
--------------------------
